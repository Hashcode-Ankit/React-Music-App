# A clean, minimalistic react music player web application.

This project was made by following Dev Ed's react course, with some of my personal tweaks. In the course, he used scss modules to style, while I used styled components. I choose to use styled components because of the advantage of being able to style based on props, which is personally, is much more convenient than add class and scss modules.
